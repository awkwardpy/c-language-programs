Install a C Compiler: If you don't have a C compiler installed, you'll need one. For Windows, you can use MinGW, and for macOS and Linux, you can use GCC. Install the appropriate compiler for your platform.

Compile and Run Programs: Navigate to the program's directory of interest using the terminal or command prompt and use the compiler to compile the C source file. For example:

gcc program_name.c -o program_name

Replace program_name.c with the name of the C source file and program_name with the desired name for the executable.

Execute the Program: After successful compilation, execute the program using the following command:

./program_name
Replace program_name with the name you provided during compilation.

Explore and Modify: Feel free to explore the program's code, experiment with modifications, and learn more about C programming.
